    "A biscuit manufacturing factory is planning to produce a series of biscuits for Christmas. Using\n",
    "the same roll of dough, the factory aims to create various biscuits in different sizes and shapes.\n",
    "The goal is to maximize biscuit production from a single dough roll while ensuring the highest\n",
    "possible profit.\n",
    "To achieve this goal, we have the following information :\n",
    "— The roll of dough is of a predefined rectangular length, referred to as ’LENGTH’, representing a one-dimensional problem.\n",
    "— The roll may contain irregularities, referred to as defects. Each defect has\n",
    "— a position ‘x‘\n",
    "— and a class, which could be one of several types (e.g., ’a’, ’b’, ’c’, ...).\n",
    "— The factory aims to produce a set of biscuits. Each Biscuit can be produced an infinite\n",
    "number of times, and has :\n",
    "— a specific size (along the same dimension as the roll)\n",
    "— a value (price)\n",
    "— and a threshold for the maximum number of defects of each class it can contain (otherwise it cannot be marketed).\n",
    "A solution is an assignment of biscuits on the roll. For an assignment to be valid, it needs to :\n",
    "— be at integer positions\n",
    "— Ensure no overlap in biscuit placement. For example, if you place a biscuit B1 of size 3 at\n",
    "position ‘x=2‘, you cannot have any biscuit assigned at positions ‘x=3‘ or ‘x=4‘.\n",
    "— Ensure that each biscuit placed on the roll contains fewer defects (or an equal number) of\n",
    "each class than its thresholds permit. For example, a biscuit B1 of size 3 placed at ‘x=2‘\n",
    "includes all defects in the interval [2, 4]. If there are 3 defects of class ’a’ in this interval,\n",
    "and B1’s threshold for class ’a’ is a maximum of 2 defects, then the assignment is invalid.\n",
    "— Ensure that the sum of the sizes of the assigned biscuits does not exceed the length of the\n",
    "roll of dough.\n",
    "The value of a solution is the sum of the values of the individual biscuits placed on it. Any part\n",
    "of the roll of dough without a biscuit assigned is considered to have a value of 0.\n",
    "2.1 Benchmark\n",
    "For this project, the following assumptions are made :\n",
    "— The length of the roll of dough is set to 500 units.\n",
    "— The roll has three classes of defects (’a’, ’b’, and ’c’). The set of defects and their positions\n",
    "on the roll are available in the ’defects.csv’ file.\n",
    "— The biscuit manufacturing factory aims to produce 4 types of biscuits, which are :\n",
    "— Biscuit 0 with a length of 4, a value 6, and maximum allowed defects as {'a' : 4, 'b' : 2, 'c' : 3}\n",
    "— Biscuit 1 with a length of 8, a value 12, and maximum allowed defects as{'a' : 5, 'b' : 4, 'c' : 4}\n",
    "— Biscuit 2 with a length of 2, a value 1, and maximum allowed defects as {'a' : 1, 'b' : 2, 'c' : 1}\n",
    "— Biscuit 3 with a length of 5, a value 8, and maximum allowed defects as {'a' : 2, 'b' : 3, 'c' : 2}"
